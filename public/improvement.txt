Now let’s talk real business level 👇
You asked: Do you need real-life payment like card machine connection?

Short answer:
👉 YES — if you want it to be a real-world commercial POS.
👉 NO — if it’s only invoice-based manual accounting software.

💳 1️⃣ Real-Life Payment Integration (Recommended for Complete POS)

In Bangladesh, most shops use:

✅ Cash (Must Have)

You already support this via Payments module.

✅ Card Payment (Very Important)

Banks in Bangladesh:

BRAC Bank

Dutch-Bangla Bank Limited

Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited

Eastern Bank Limited

They provide POS machines.

🔹 Your software doesn’t directly connect to the bank machine usually.
Instead:

Cashier selects Card Payment

Enters Card Amount

Enters Transaction ID from POS machine receipt

Uploads optional slip image

That’s enough for 90% shops.

✅ Mobile Banking (VERY IMPORTANT in Bangladesh)

You MUST support:

bKash

Nagad

Rocket

Two options:

Option A (Simple – Recommended for you now)

Just:

Add payment type: bkash / nagad / rocket

Store:

Sender number

Transaction ID

Screenshot

No API needed. Very common.

Option B (Advanced)

Integrate bKash API (auto verify payment).
⚠️ More complex. Not needed if you’re new.

🧾 2️⃣ What Makes a POS “Complete”?

Here’s what your system should have:

🔹 A. Sales Side

Invoice create

Multiple payment types (cash + card + mobile banking)

Partial payment

Due management

Return / Refund system (IMPORTANT ❗)

Do you have:

Sales return?

Invoice cancel?

Credit note?

If not → Add this.

🔹 B. Inventory Side

Must have:

Stock auto reduce after invoice

Stock alert (low quantity warning)

Barcode support (VERY IMPORTANT for POS)

Add:

Barcode scanner support (USB scanner works like keyboard)

Print barcode labels

🔹 C. Hardware Integration (Optional but Powerful)

You can add later:

Thermal printer (80mm)

Cash drawer auto open

Barcode scanner

Card machine manual integration

Customer display monitor

No heavy API needed. Most hardware works via browser print.

🔹 D. Reports (Business Owners Love This)

Add:

Daily Sales Report

Profit Report

Top Selling Product

Sales by Payment Type

Cash Book

VAT report (if needed)

🏦 3️⃣ Bangladesh Compliance Things

Depending on business size:

VAT % option

BIN number field

Company TIN field

Customer VAT field

Print invoice in Bangla format

Not all small shops need NBR integration.

🚀 My Honest Opinion For You (Since You're New)

Don’t jump into:

Bank API

Card machine direct integration

Payment gateway system

Instead:

✅ Step 1 – Complete Core POS

Multi payment types

Return system

Stock auto update

Reports

✅ Step 2 – Add Mobile Banking Manual Entry

That’s enough for Bangladesh real market.

✅ Step 3 – Hardware Friendly

Make:

Printable invoice (thermal size)

Barcode scanning ready

🔥 If You Want To Make It Professional Level

Add:

Customer loyalty points

SMS invoice notification

Installment system

Multi-branch support

User activity logs

Audit trail

💡 Final Answer For You

You DO NOT need:
❌ Direct card machine API
❌ Complex payment gateway
❌ Bank integration

You DO NEED:
✅ Cash
✅ Card (manual entry)
✅ bKash / Nagad / Rocket manual entry
✅ Return system
✅ Stock automation
✅ Reports

That will make your POS 100% usable in Bangladesh market.

my purchase list done, now what are remaining

Okay babe 😎🔥 now we’re talking real system flow.

You said:

✅ Purchase list done
So that means:

You can create purchases

You are adding stock when buying

Supplier is linked

Amount calculation is working

Good. That covers the BUY side.

Now let’s organize what is still remaining in a proper POS / Inventory workflow 👇

🧠 FULL SYSTEM FLOW (Simple Version)
1️⃣ BUY SIDE (Stock In)

Module: Purchase

You already have:

Purchase Create

Purchase List

Supplier

Product

Unit

Brand

✅ Done.

Optional improvements:

Purchase Return

Purchase Report

Supplier Payment Tracking

2️⃣ SELL SIDE (Stock Out)

Module: Sales / Invoice

Do you have these?

Sales Create (cart style or normal form)

Sales List

Invoice Print

Stock deduction on sale

If NOT → this is your next step 🔥

This is where your brother’s “Buy/Sell” comment fits:

| Buy | → | Purchase Module |
| Sell | → | Sales / Invoice Module |

3️⃣ PAYMENT FLOW

After selling:

You need:

Cash Payment

Card Payment

Bank Deposit (if card goes to bank)

Petty Cash (if physical cash)

If already done → good.

If not → connect payment to invoice.

4️⃣ STOCK CONTROL

You must have:

Product Current Stock column

Auto increase on purchase

Auto decrease on sale

If this is not automated yet → this is VERY important.

5️⃣ REPORTS (VERY IMPORTANT NOW)

Since you have many modules already, now you need visibility.

Minimum professional reports:

🔹 1. Purchase Report

Date wise

Supplier wise

Total amount

🔹 2. Sales Report

Daily sales

Monthly sales

Customer wise

🔹 3. Profit Report (Simple Version)

Sale Total – Purchase Cost

Even a basic version is enough.

🔹 4. Stock Report

Product name

Total purchased

Total sold

Current stock

This one is CRITICAL.

📌 What Is Remaining For You (Priority Order)

Since Purchase is done, next logical steps are:

🔥 Step 1: Sales Module (if not completed)
🔥 Step 2: Auto Stock Update Logic
🔥 Step 3: Sales Report
🔥 Step 4: Stock Report
🔥 Step 5: Profit Summary

Everything else is advanced ERP level.
