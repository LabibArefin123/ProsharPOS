Now let’s talk real business level 👇
You asked: Do you need real-life payment like card machine connection?

Short answer:
👉 YES — if you want it to be a real-world commercial POS.
👉 NO — if it’s only invoice-based manual accounting software.

💳 1️⃣ Real-Life Payment Integration (Recommended for Complete POS)

In Bangladesh, most shops use:

✅ Cash (Must Have)

You already support this via Payments module.

✅ Card Payment (Very Important)

Banks in Bangladesh:

BRAC Bank

Dutch-Bangla Bank Limited

Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited

Eastern Bank Limited

They provide POS machines.

🔹 Your software doesn’t directly connect to the bank machine usually.
Instead:

Cashier selects Card Payment

Enters Card Amount

Enters Transaction ID from POS machine receipt

Uploads optional slip image

That’s enough for 90% shops.

✅ Mobile Banking (VERY IMPORTANT in Bangladesh)

You MUST support:

bKash

Nagad

Rocket

Two options:

Option A (Simple – Recommended for you now)

Just:

Add payment type: bkash / nagad / rocket

Store:

Sender number

Transaction ID

Screenshot

No API needed. Very common.

Option B (Advanced)

Integrate bKash API (auto verify payment).
⚠️ More complex. Not needed if you’re new.

🧾 2️⃣ What Makes a POS “Complete”?

Here’s what your system should have:

🔹 A. Sales Side

Invoice create

Multiple payment types (cash + card + mobile banking)

Partial payment

Due management

Return / Refund system (IMPORTANT ❗)

Do you have:

Sales return?

Invoice cancel?

Credit note?

If not → Add this.

🔹 B. Inventory Side

Must have:

Stock auto reduce after invoice

Stock alert (low quantity warning)

Barcode support (VERY IMPORTANT for POS)

Add:

Barcode scanner support (USB scanner works like keyboard)

Print barcode labels

🔹 C. Hardware Integration (Optional but Powerful)

You can add later:

Thermal printer (80mm)

Cash drawer auto open

Barcode scanner

Card machine manual integration

Customer display monitor

No heavy API needed. Most hardware works via browser print.

🔹 D. Reports (Business Owners Love This)

Add:

Daily Sales Report

Profit Report

Top Selling Product

Sales by Payment Type

Cash Book

VAT report (if needed)

🏦 3️⃣ Bangladesh Compliance Things

Depending on business size:

VAT % option

BIN number field

Company TIN field

Customer VAT field

Print invoice in Bangla format

Not all small shops need NBR integration.

🚀 My Honest Opinion For You (Since You're New)

Don’t jump into:

Bank API

Card machine direct integration

Payment gateway system

Instead:

✅ Step 1 – Complete Core POS

Multi payment types

Return system

Stock auto update

Reports

✅ Step 2 – Add Mobile Banking Manual Entry

That’s enough for Bangladesh real market.

✅ Step 3 – Hardware Friendly

Make:

Printable invoice (thermal size)

Barcode scanning ready

🔥 If You Want To Make It Professional Level

Add:

Customer loyalty points

SMS invoice notification

Installment system

Multi-branch support

User activity logs

Audit trail
